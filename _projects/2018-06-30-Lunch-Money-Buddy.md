Course: Interaction Design

Tools: Paper, Balsamiq, Proto.io/Invision

Role: Interaction Designer

## Problem
For this project, I was given seven weeks to created a mobile app called “Lunch Money Buddy.” The app allows parents and guardians of school age children to manage various aspects of their kids’ in-school cafeteria lunch accounts.
The app allows parents and guardians to do the following things:

* Download and sign up.
* Add funds the account.
* View account balance.
* View school lunch menu by child.
* View subsidy status.
* Add a lunch to a list of favorites.
* Close account.

## Actions
User personas as well as application specifications were provided as a starting point for this assignment. From there I created user journeys for the provided personas as well as a sitemap for the application. Next I began to sketch out wireframes for Lunch Money Buddy on paper based of my user journeys and sitemap. After sketching I recreated my wireframes digitally using a wire-framing tool called Balsamiq. Then I moved my design to proto.io which is a prototyping tool. Here I made my wireframes interactive. Including navigation, gesture controls, and finalized all interactions and micro interactions. Finally, I added example content to prepare for usability testing.

## Results
Below are some screenshots of the deliverables created as well as a link to the prototype.

## Lessons Learned
From this Project I learned the following:
* The common methodologies, expectations and deliverables of interaction Design.
* How to create appropriate user journeys utilizing user personas.
* How to create sitemaps through effective visual presentation.
* The different types of wireframes and their appropriate use in interaction design.
* Create wireframes based on project research, user personas, user journeys, and sitemaps.
* How to Identify standard navigational structures for mobile projects.
* How to construct a functioning prototype that will allow for basic user testing.
* The importance of constructive feedback, Critique, and peer interaction.
