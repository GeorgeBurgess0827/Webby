With 8 years of experience at Accenture, I have a strong foundation in design, development, and deployment of software solutions using languages such as Java, JavaScript and Python. I am proficient in analyzing business requirements and translating them into technical solutions, and have a track record of delivering successful projects on time and within budget. I am a strong communicator and thrive in team environments. 

My ambition is to continue growing and developing my skills in both Front-End Development as well as UX Design. I have always been interested in the intersection of technology and design and believe that my background in application development has given me a unique perspective and set of skills that I can bring to the UX/UI world.
