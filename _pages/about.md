My ambition is to one day become proficient at both Front-End Development as well as UX Design. With the combination of these two skill sets I will be able to design and build anything I want! But more realistically, I would be the perfect liaison between designers and developers.

I completed my masterâ€™s degree in UX design in August of 2017. I would like to transition into a UX/UI designer role to better reinforce my studies and gain valuable real-world experience.
