I have a wild dream of becoming a Front-End Development and UX Design wizard, able to conjure up beautiful and functional websites with just a flick of my magic wand (or a few lines of code). But let's be real here, I'll probably just end up being the go-to person for when designers and developers need a translation guide.

I recently received my degree in UX design and am now ready to unleash my skills upon the world (or at least, the world of design and development). Time to get out there and make some magic happen!
