# Usability Study Building Blocks

For this week, our focus was to learn about creating recruiting screeners and creating tasks for usability studies.

In this week’s assignment we where given a scenario and assigned user groups. Based on that, we had to create a 10 question screener and 10 tasks for a usability study. In the scenario, we are asked to conduct a study on Papa John’s website. Our main focus was to evaluate their online ordering via the website.

We were also assigned groups for this assignment. In my group we had to develop the screener and tasks for advanced users. By Thursday, we had to post five of our question and five of our task. It was cool to see that many of my group members had the same general ideas. I also was able to modify some of their items that I didn’t even consider and add them to my final list.

Overall I really enjoyed this week!
