## Module 3, Week 1:

## Conducting an Eye Tracking Usability Study/Selling Usability

 

This week we began learning about eye tracking. but I decided to take another route.

We have an assignment to create email for a beekeeping company called "Bees.com". the point of the email is to convince them that a UX  assessment should be included in the upcoming website development.

Before writing the email we had to read a book called "Selling Usability" by John Rhodes. This by far is one of the best books I read in a while. Tt took me a while to finish because of work but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The book has really good tip on how to get UX into Companies where they might even know what UX is.

So far, I have written my email out but I think I'm going to rewrite it a few more times until I find one I like.

Here is a link to the book on amazon: [Here](https://www.amazon.com/Selling-Usability-Experience-Infiltration-Tactics/dp/1442103736)
