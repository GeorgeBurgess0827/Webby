## Module 3, Week 2: Analyzing the Results of Eye Tracking

This  was the final  week of this course. I mainly  focused on finishing the  eye tracking assignment as well as cleaning up my selling usability email.

### Eye tracking Assignment

This was an interesting topic to learn about and it made see how useful this type of study could be.

I really struggled with this assignment. it felt like  the sessions, gaze plots, and heat maps were all kind of inconsistent. So I did the best that I could. Also I based my tasks off of the updated website. the original sessions and data was based on the site from 2012.

All in all, I learned a lot out of this class. even though some of the material was dated. I feel like it is good to know how things were in the beginning. On to the next.

Happy Holidays!
