## WireFraming Part 1

This was the second week of the course and also the first of two weeks that we have to create our wireframes for the Lunch Money Buddy Mobile app which will be used by parents to add lunch money to their children’s account at school. I felt like I made a lot of progress this week. I began sketching my wireframes by hand. Once I decided on designs I really liked, I recreated them digitally using a tool called [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) which one of my classmates suggested back in the first course of the program. Since I am terrible at drawing I felt like this would be the best route and would help my classmate understand my wireframes better.
