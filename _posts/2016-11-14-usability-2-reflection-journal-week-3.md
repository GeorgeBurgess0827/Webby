## Module 1, Week 3: Unmoderated Remote Usability

For this week, we had to analyze our finding from our studies as well as create a presentation. unfortunately I was not able to get more than three participants, so I just went with what I had.

Overall I didn't have a hard time analyzing the results because validity made it really easy. The one area I struggled was the actual presentation. I wasn't really sure what to include. also I'm not really good at presentations. something I'm working on.

But overall, I just went with it and learned a lot along the way.

We were also given a really nice video to watch on unmoderated remote usability studies. here is the link:
