# Usability 1 Reflection Journal Week 2

In this Week’s module we were introduces to Summative and formative Usability studies.

For this week’s assignment, we had to play the role of a UX researcher for a medium-sized pizza company. Our task was to conduct a usability study for an online pizza ordering website. The site had to be completed in time for the super bowl and we were currently in November. Also the site was already in early development and was past the wire framing and prototyping stages. Our main goal was to decide to either conduct either one summative study or two formative studies and then convince the CEO why that was the right choice.

There was no wrong answer. But I opted to go with summative because of the time constraint and I felt like it would be easier to pitch one study versus two. Honestly I felt like I could have chosen either one or a combination of the two.

For this post we were asked the following question:

_**“How framing studies in this way might, or might not, have helped your work.”**_

Honesty at my current job I don’t any sort on UXD work. But we are currently in the process of automating some of the manual task that we do. I think performing iterative formative studies within our team could help us see which specific tasks  we need to focus on.
