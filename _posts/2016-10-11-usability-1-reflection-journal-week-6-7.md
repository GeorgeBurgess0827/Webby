## Analyzing Data and Creating a Usability Report

In these final two weeks we had to select three videos from our classmates( the ones we recorded in week 5) and analyze the data. afterwards we had to create an final report.

honestly this was very difficult for me.  I guess that's why we were given two weeks. the assigned reading really helped though and I think I got a good understanding of how to do the report. I ran into a lot of issues though. One was that some of the videos I watched either didn't have sound or the audio was really bad. Also after analysing the sessions. I really didn't find much. Only minor little things that could be improved. so it was hard deciding what I should write. But all in all I think it was a good learning experience. This seems like something that gets better the more you do it.
