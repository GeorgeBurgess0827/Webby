## Module 2, Week 1:Â Mobile Device Usability Testing

in this week, we began to learn about usability test for mobile devices like phones and tablets.

We primarily read artcicles & assigned chapters as well as watched videos. But it was good to see where mobile testing started and how it has developed over the years. We were assigned chapters from a book called "Mobile Usability" which was a little dated but still provided some good information.

Also I began working on the assignment of the module. Which was to set up my own mobile device usability study. So far I have completed my outline and formatting and came up with a few ideas for my setup. but i still have a long way to go.
