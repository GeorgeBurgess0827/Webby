# Module 1, Week 1: Remote vs Face to Face

This week we learned about the Benefits of Remote Usability Testing  As well when remote usability could be more appropriate than in-person testing or face to face.

Here are some of the benefits from the readings:

- Easier Recruitment
- Geographic Diversity
- Speed
- Lower Cost

We also were introduced to three tool that we could use for remote testing. all of which have there pros and cons. i think it was cool seeing how different companies handle remote testing and recruiting. This week we had to compare Mturk to Ethnio

- **[Validately](https://validately.com/)**
- **[Ethnio](https://ethn.io/)**
- **[Mturk](https://requester.mturk.com/)**

Another topic that was introduced was moderated vs. moderated remote testing.In moderated testing you and participant are both present. in moderated test the participant completed the session on their own time and you can view the session later. that just one of the differences.

For the next two weeks we will be using Validately to conduct a unmoderated usability study.
