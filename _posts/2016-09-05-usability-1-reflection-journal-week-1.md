## Usability 1 Reflection Journal Week 1

This was the first week of usability 1. a class I have been excited to start since enrolling in the program. For this I had to read assigned material that gave a brief overview of usability and usability testing. I also had to write a class discussion explaining a good and bad example of usability. I chose to write about 24/7 roadside assistance. Long story short never use a service called N2plus. I suggest OnStar or AAA.

The main assignment for this was to pick a number of participants for a usability study and provide justification on why this amount is all that is needed. A lot of the assigned reading helped and I was also able to talk to my career counselor at work. That gave me a real world example that help me understand better. All in all, this a great first week!
