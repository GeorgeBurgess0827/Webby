## Module 2, Week 2: Usability Testing Gestures on Mobile Devices

This week we continued on our projects and also had a discussion post on testing gesture and usability controls.

 

**The Project**

I was able to get it done despite dealing with procrastination because of thanksgiving food, black friday, leftover thanksgiving food, setting up the christmas tree, and even more leftovers. I was able to mock-up my lab setup using balsamiq. with I thought was pretty cool. I also learned about a screen capture software called Lookback and a camera I can attach to mobile devices called the Mr. Tappy. First I think the name of the camera is awesome and the product itself looks way better to anything I could have made on my own.

**The Discussion Post**

I think pretty much all of my classmates agreed that we should include testing for touch and gesture controls. It was cool seeing all of the different opinion everyone had.
